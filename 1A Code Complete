Miyagi Car wash Program
Lead developer:					Mariah Belcher
Destructive testing consultant: Sean Crews

This program provides automated car wash control via text driven menus.
The following menus are available: car wash type and employee.
All input and output is saved to a text file to prvoid a customer
receipt and sent to a vectored array for record keeping and accounting purposes.

Due to time constraints, only basic functionality has been fully
developed for this program.

***CAUTION: this program was developed specifically to operate on a ten
digit keypad. Entry of ANY character or string outside of the scope provided
by the menus will, in technical terms, HOSE the program.
